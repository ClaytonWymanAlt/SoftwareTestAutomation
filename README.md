# SoftwareTestAutomation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

Tests are a great tool in incorporating multiple needs into the development of software. Using tests creates a solid way to ensure code is functional without manual testing, that it has to be able to do the stated things to qualify as functional code. In addition, using tests this way provides a solid way to integrate user needs and requirements. If user requirements are made into tests, then programs can be made to fulfill those tests, and then as a result fulfill the requirements. Tests have changed how I design my software as a result. A greater reliance on functions makes a more easily tested program, and as a result also results in cleaner code. Overall, usage of testing has made a positive impact on my own development cycle.
